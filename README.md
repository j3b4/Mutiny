# Welcome to Portage
This is a learning project by Joshua Bearden intended to help me learn enough
to eventually build a project tentatively titled Mutiny Mud. A multi-user text
game summed up with the Hollywood style pitch: Horatio Hornblower meets Dwarf
Fortress.  If that means something to you, you might be interested in this
project.

# Project Management
I will try to keep all project management in the Manifest Folder.  I use vim
outliner so my files are named .otl but can be viewed and edited with any text
editor.

# Getting started

It's highly recommended that you look up Evennia's extensive
documentation found here: https://github.com/evennia/evennia/wiki.

Plenty of beginner's tutorials can be found here:
