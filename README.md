# Welcome to Portage
## "Horatio Hornblower meets Dwarf Fortress!"  
If that means something to you, you might be interested in this project. Even if it doesn't the project might interest you if you love Naval action and adventure set during the Age of Sail (1650-1850).  

Please consider yourself invited to discuss what this would mean on the wiki: https://github.com/j3b4/PortageMud/wiki

# Project Management
I will try to keep all project management in the Manifest Folder.  I use vim
outliner so my files are named .otl but can be viewed and edited with any text
editor.

# Getting started

It's highly recommended that you look up Evennia's extensive
documentation found here: https://github.com/evennia/evennia/wiki.

Plenty of beginner's tutorials can be found here:
