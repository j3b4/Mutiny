Current Work Order
	[_] fix "look" on board so that it overloads "look" (refer to 
		: tutorial bridge room world bridge room for example)
		: Do this first because it will inform the other projects
		default look on board should display the view outside ship plus just
	[_] Globe
		: a dictionary of tuples.  
		: probably an object/class containing the dictionary and an interface
		: for editing and reviewing its contents.
		[_] create a "globe object" in world.
			[_] learn how other typeclasses can access it
		[_] Accessible by certain commands
			[_] @dig
				: should update the globe with position for every new room
				: probably manually.
			[_] @tunnel
				: tunnel is like @dig but will it be allowed to automatically
				: choose positions?
				:
				: I doubt it because I don't think I'm prepared to make the
				: globe actualy responsible for enforcing cartesian reality
			[_] move_to()
				: need to be able to look up positions in order to see where
				: to move an object
			[_] CmdFix
				: a player/builder command to see current coordinates
				: an ingame version of this 
	[_] CmdSteer
		: Work on making steer check where it is.
		[_] locked to "inside vessel"
	[_] default room
	[_] coastal room
Clean Up - REFACTORING for Sanity (et la sant√©    
	Continue [SEA NAVIGATION](SEA NAVIGATION)**
		overload "steer" 
			: so that it sets the course and then begins to move over time...
			: (see delayed execeution tut) so I should be able to "steer N"
			: and then the ship will sail N, slowly updating position
			: periodically.
		Announce upon sighting land OR 
			: better yet, automatically "landfall" when entering a coastal
			: coordinate.  that would stop me from blithely sailing inland.  
	the name of the ship room
			with arguments you can look only inboard or only out to sea
		store global position as a tuple of integers (or floats?)
			Using my forced "setpos" command I input the position as a string. - just clean this up.
			So also need to store position on objects as a tuple.
			object contents should all automatically inherit position. 
				:Ie. so that if a sailor jumps overboard at sea, they will end
				:up in the sea rather than back in the room where they boarded
				:or something.
			find out how to update the "globe" 
				: (my dictionary of coastal positions) whenever building
				: rooms.  on that note, add position property to ALL land and
				: coastal rooms (but not ship rooms)
Implement boats.
	simple single-room vehicles
		DONE: players can enter and steer the boat around other rooms
	multi-roomed ships
		main deck, quarter-deck, the masthead, the bilge, state room, ward
	room, galley, gun deck etc...
Implement the Ocean
	**coastal waters** (Right now they are justt standard rooms and the boat can go anywhere)
		half land and half sea rooms. Characters can walk along the land part using land exits.
		boats traverse water-exits
		boats can transition from the coastal water to the high sea.
		characters should not be able to without a boat
    **High Sea**
Implement Crew (npcs that sail or help you sail) 
Future
	Ship to ship combat
	Naval organization and ranking system
	Economy
	WIND & WEATHER at sea, on the coast, and inland
