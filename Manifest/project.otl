Current Work Order
	[X] CmdSteer
		Notes:
			: Work on making steer check where it is.  Wait, I think I got it.
			: If the sea room has headings as commands...  Just like the
			: coastal room had exits...  Then "steer nw" will work as
			: expected. 
			:
			: This will suffice at this stage. The future goal of having 32 or
			: even 360 headings can probably wait. 
			:
			: For now I'll be happy with at least 8 and at most 16 headings.
			: 16 headings will suffice me a long time I think.  
			:
			: So the headings, are like exits, commands attached to the room.
			: This means u don't even have to do anything to the "steer"
			: command. At least not on this account. I might still want to
			: consider a way to prevent vessels from executing too many random
			: commands.
		[X] locked to "inside vessel"
			: No, better to keep using the parser to simply give an error msg
			: to players who try to steer from outside the vessel.
	[_] Globe
		: a dictionary of tuples.  
		: probably an object/class containing the dictionary and an interface
		: for editing and reviewing its contents.
		[_] create a "globe object" in world.
			[_] learn how other typeclasses can access it
		[_] Accessible by certain commands
			[_] @dig
				: should update the globe with position for every new room
				: probably manually.
			[_] @tunnel
				: tunnel is like @dig but will it be allowed to automatically
				: choose positions?
				:
				: I doubt it because I don't think I'm prepared to make the
				: globe actualy responsible for enforcing cartesian reality
			[_] move_to()
				: need to be able to look up positions in order to see where
				: to move an object
			[_] CmdFix
				: a player/builder command to see current coordinates
				: an ingame version of this 
	[_] default room
	[_] coastal room
	[X] Debug "at_after_move" hook on vessel typeclass.
		: Fixed by reseting skiff to use vessel typeclass
	[X] fix "look" on board so that it overloads "look" (refer to 
		: tutorial bridge room world bridge room for example)
		: Do this first because it will inform the other projects
		: default look on board should display the view outside ship plus just
		: perhaps the name of the vessel?
Clean Up - REFACTORING for Sanity (et la sant√©    
	Continue [SEA NAVIGATION](SEA NAVIGATION)**
		overload "steer" 
			: so that it sets the course and then begins to move over time...
			: (see delayed execeution tut) so I should be able to "steer N"
			: and then the ship will sail N, slowly updating position
			: periodically.
		Announce upon sighting land OR 
			: better yet, automatically "landfall" when entering a coastal
			: coordinate.  that would stop me from blithely sailing inland.  
	the name of the ship room
			with arguments you can look only inboard or only out to sea
		store global position as a tuple of integers (or floats?)
			Using my forced "setpos" command I input the position as a string. - just clean this up.
			So also need to store position on objects as a tuple.
			object contents should all automatically inherit position. 
				:Ie. so that if a sailor jumps overboard at sea, they will end
				:up in the sea rather than back in the room where they boarded
				:or something.
			find out how to update the "globe" 
				: (my dictionary of coastal positions) whenever building
				: rooms.  on that note, add position property to ALL land and
				: coastal rooms (but not ship rooms)
Implement boats.
	simple single-room vehicles
		DONE: players can enter and steer the boat around other rooms
	multi-roomed ships
		main deck, quarter-deck, the masthead, the bilge, state room, ward
	room, galley, gun deck etc...
Implement the Ocean
	**coastal waters** (Right now they are justt standard rooms and the boat can go anywhere)
		half land and half sea rooms. Characters can walk along the land part using land exits.
		boats traverse water-exits
		boats can transition from the coastal water to the high sea.
		characters should not be able to without a boat
    **High Sea**
Implement Crew (npcs that sail or help you sail) 
Future
	Ship to ship combat
	Naval organization and ranking system
	Economy
	WIND & WEATHER at sea, on the coast, and inland
